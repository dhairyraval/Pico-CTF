# PicoCTF Notes
## Level: The Numbers

For this level we're given a `the_numbers.png` file containing a bunch of seemingly random numbers

* Taking a closer look at the format in which the numbers are displayed we can see that it resembles the text format of a flag (picoCTF{...})

If we map the numbers to the corresponding alphabets we get the flag

## Flag:
``` PICOCTF{THENUMBERSMASON} ```
