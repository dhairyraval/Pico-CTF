# PicoCTF Notes
## Level: Time Machine

This level Git Basics intro

For this level we're given a folder with a .txt file inside.

Reading the level description we know that the flag can be found in this folder - but we'd need to view the commit history for that.

## Commands Ran:
```bash
# Using the git log cmd we can view the history of commits
git log
```

## Flag:
``` picoCTF{t1m3m@ch1n3_e8c98b3a} ```
