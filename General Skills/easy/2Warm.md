# PicoCTF Notes
## Level: 2Warm

For this level we just need to convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2) and submit that in the following format as the flag:

`picoCTF{<binary-number>}`

We can use various online calculators, chatGPT, cmd line tools for the conversion

The logic used for this conversion is fairly straightforward and explained in detail in [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decimal-to-binary/) geeksforgeeks article

42 (base 10) = __101010__ (base 2/binary)

## Flag:
``` picoCTF{101010} ```
