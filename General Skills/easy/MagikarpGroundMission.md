# PicoCTF Notes
## Level: Magikarp Ground Mission

This level is a basic intro to `ssh`, moving between directories and reading files in the shell

The flag is split into 3 `.txt` files which are spread around the machine 

Moving around we `cd` and using shorthand like `/` and `~` we can access the `.txt` files

We can get the contents printed out to the shell using `cat`

## Flag:
``` picoCTF{xxsh_0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_71be5264} ```
