# PicoCTF Notes
## Level: Obedient Cat

This level is an intro to the `cat` command

We're given a file `flag` and told that the flag for the leve is stored in this file

Running:
```bash
cat flag
```
Prints the contents of the file to the terminal window and we can get the flag from there

## Flag:
``` picoCTF{s4n1ty_v3r1f13d_28e8376d} ```
