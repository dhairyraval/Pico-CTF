# PicoCTF Notes
## Level: binhexa

This level introduces binary arithemtic and bitwise operations 

We're given 2 binary numbers are have to perform operations like `|`, `+`, `*`, `<<` on them.

There are terminal tools like `bc` which can be used to solve binary operations. But I prefer just looking up online calculators for this
