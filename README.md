# PicoCTF Notes
This repository contains my notes from various challenges on [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/), a cybersecurity CTF and learning platform.

## Structure

- Notes for individual challenges are organized into folders based on their general domain (e.g., cryptography, forensics, web exploitation)

- Within each domain, challenges are further categorized into subfolders based on difficulty level (e.g., `easy/`, `medium/`)

- The `template.md` file is a basic template I use for structuring my notes.

## Usage
- Navigate to the relevant category folder to find challenge-specific notes.
