# PicoCTF Notes
## Level: GET aHEAD

For this level we're given a [target website](http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/) where we need to get the flag from.

Looking at the description of the level and level hints - it's being highlighted that we might have more that the 2 options (__Chooser Red__ and __Choose Blue__) that are present on the landing page of the target site

* The level name: GET aHEAD gives us another hint that we could try sending a HEAD req to the target.

* There are many ways to do this: using Postman, BurpSuite, terminal

* I ended using `curl` command on the terminal as this was the easiest

```bash
curl -I http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/

# The -I flag is used with curl to send HEAD requests
```

## Flag:
``` picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_2e5ba39f} ```
