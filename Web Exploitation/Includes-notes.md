# PicoCTF Notes
## Level: Includes

For this level we're given:

* A target website

and we need to find the flag from there

Looking around at the included files we can get:

* The 1st part of the flag from the `styles.css`

* The 2nd part from `script.js`

## Flag:
``` picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_b8f4b022} ```
