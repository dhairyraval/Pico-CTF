# PicoCTF Notes
## Level: Unminify

This one's similar to WebDecode challenge - the flag is hidden in the source code

There's a lot of quick ways to find hidden flags in the src codes, here's a terminal based approach that I use:

 - A combination of `curl` | `grep` - this way we request the src code and extract the relevant part in 1 go


## Flag:
``` picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_d9c45a0b} ```
