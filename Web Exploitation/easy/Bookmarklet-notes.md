## Level: Bookmarklet
This level i an inro to bookmarklets

Bookmarklets are just like bookmarks for browsers, but instead of website URLs they store and execute JS code

They can be used for automation, data extraction and other debugging purposes

For this level we're given a bookmarklet and we need to execute it on the target page

Executing the bookmarklet gives us the flag
