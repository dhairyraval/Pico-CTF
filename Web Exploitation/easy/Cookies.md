# PicoCTF Notes
## Level: Cookies

Weird one - for this level we're given a target site and we need to find the flag from there

Looking at the level description it's hinted that this level is related to changing the cookie values

Initially it's set to -1 and if we enter a valid input (eg: snickerdoodle) the cookie value changes to 1

We just have to repeatedly try increasing cookie values till we set the cookie = 18 which gives us the flag


## Flag:
``` picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_064663be} ```
