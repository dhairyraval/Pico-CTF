# PicoCTF Notes
## Level: Local Authority

For this level we're given:

* A target website where we need to find the flag
* The following hint: `"How is the password checked on this website?"`

Trying a wrong login gives us access to the `secure.js` script used to check the creds

All the validation is done on client side and we can view the valid creds

```text
username = 'admin'
password = 'strongPassword098765'
```

## Flag:
``` picoCTF{j5_15_7r4n5p4r3n7_a8788e61} ```
