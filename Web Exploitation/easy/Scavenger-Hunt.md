# PicoCTF Notes
## Level: Scavenger Hunt

For this level we're given a target website at:
`http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/` 

and told that the flag is hidden somewhere around this site


### Enumeration

* The 1st part of the flag can be found in the src code for __index.html__ (the landing page) - `picoCTF{t`

* Similarly found the 2nd part in the __mycss.css__ file for the landing page - `h4ts_4_l0`

* Looking at the __myjs.js__ file for the landing page - we can see a comment which says: "How can I keep Google from indexing my website?"

    We use __robots.txt__ to inform search engines about pages on our site we don't want indexed

    Opening robots.txt gives us the 3rd part of the flag - `t_0f_pl4c`

* The robots.txt also gives us a hint for the next part of the flag: "I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?"

    Opening the __.htaccess__ (which is a common hidden file containing rules related to auth, redirects and access controls for the website) gives us the 4th part of the flag - `3s_2_lO0k`

* We get the following hint for the next part of the flag - "I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there"

    Generally with macOS we use the __.DS_Store__ hidden file to store metadata

    Opening the .DS_Store file gives us the final part of the flag - `_7a46d25d}` 

## Flag:
``` picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_7a46d25d} ```
