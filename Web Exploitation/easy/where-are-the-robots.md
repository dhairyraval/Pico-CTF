# PicoCTF Notes
## Level: where are the robots

For this level we're given a [target](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/) website

We're given the following hint:

"What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?"

This tells us that we can probably find the flag if we access the __robots.txt__ file - this file is used to inform search engines about pages on websites that we don't want indexed

Accessing the __robots.txt__ at `<target>/robots.txt` gives us the address of a page that is being disallowed from indexing - `/1bb4c.html`

Vising `<target>/1bb4c.html` gives us the flag!

## Flag:
``` picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_1bb4c} ```
