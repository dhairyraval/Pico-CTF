# PicoCTF Notes
## Level: logon

For this level we're given a [target site](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44573/ "Factory Login")

On this site we can successfully login with any combination of `username` & `password` except when trying to login as the user __Joe__

I tried login in with random credentials and then took closer look at the __cookies__ that the site is using.

* One of the cookies is called __admin__ and its value is set as __False__ 

* Updating the value to __True__ and refreshing the page gives us the flag

* This works as the site is using client-side cookies for authenticating whether a user has the privileges to view the flag or not
