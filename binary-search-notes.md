# PicoCTF Notes
## Level: Binary Search

This level is just a basic introduction to the Binary Search Concept.

We need to guess the right number between **1 & 1000**, but we only have **10 chances**.  
We get an output of **higher/lower** after every wrong guess.

By manually entering numbers following the **Binary Search pattern** (250, 375, 312, etc.),  
we get the correct number: **310**.
